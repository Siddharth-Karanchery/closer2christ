    title: "About",
    body: `I was once a lost sheep of Christ. Who strayed far from Him, was tempted to challenge Him, to question Him. I lived most of my life in this way. However, He will never let His sheep stray for too long. He
came for me, He made me see the err of my ways. Picked me up even though I did not deserve it and loved me even thought I hadn't earned it. \n\n Over the past couple of years, I have spent my time in learning more about our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ, about The Holy Trinity, the
teachings of the Catholic Church and anything about my faith, that would bring me closer to Christ. And I came to realise that there might be others out there who are lost and have been found. So I set out to use my God given skills as a web developer to help my fellow
brothers and sisters in Christ in order make their journey to get closer to Christ, a bit easier. \n\n Please feel free to reach out with thoughts, feedback and suggestions. May the peace of our Lord be with you always`,
